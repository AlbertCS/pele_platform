Elucidating the binding path with the OutIn package
===================================================
In this tutorial we will use the OutIn package to predict the binding path of an inhibitor of tyrosine kinase domain of fibroblast growth factor receptor 1 (PDB 1AGW) using
an APO (PDB 1FGK) structure as a starting point.

1. Protein file
----------------

We will be using SchrÃ¶dinger Maestro (release 2021-3) to preprocess a complex of interest from Protein Data Bank so
that it can be used by PELE (Protein Energy Landscape Exploration).

In general, PELE input files need to follow a few guidelines:

    * The protein needs to be correctly protonated.
    * The ligand must be in a separate, unique chain.
    * Ligand residue name cannot be ``UNK``.
    * We also recommend removing any solvents and crystallization artefacts.

a. **Download the protein structures** 1AGW (holo) and 1FGK (apo) by clicking on ``File -> Get PDB`` and inputting their respective codes. Once the download is complete, you should see both structures in the entry list on the left panel.

b. **Preprocess the holo structure**. Select entry 1AGW, click on ``Tasks`` and search ``Protein Preparation Wizard``. Check the following options and hit ``Preprocess``. When prompted about multiple occupancy issues, simply select all entries and ``Commit``.

If you do not have Prime installed, you can skip filling in missing loops and side chains, but we do recommend doing that.

c. **Extract the ligand**. Select the ligand, then click on the ``Build`` menu and copy it to a new entry. It should show up in the entry list on the left.

d. **Preprocess the apo structure**. Select entry 1FGK and remove all chains except for B, you can do that by selecting each chain and using the ``Delete selected atoms`` button in the ``Build`` menu. Preprocess remaining chain with ``Protein Preparation Wizard`` using the same options as before.

::

e. **Merge**. Select the preprocessed 1FGK and ligand entries, then right click and ``Merge`` into one entry. The ligand can be placed anywhere in the system, since PELE will automatically move it to the simulation box.

f. **Adjust ligand properties**. Select the ligand, open ``Build`` and choose ``Other edits -> Change atom properties...``. Set residue name to **LIG** and chain name to **Z**. Choose ``PDB atom name`` from the drop down list and select ``Set unique PDB atom names within residues``. Click ``Apply`` and close the window.

::

g. **Save** the merged entry as ``system.pdb`` in your working directory.


2. PELE configuration file
--------------------------

Create ``input.yaml`` file in your working directory, it should contain the following flags:

    - **system** - path to the protein-ligand PDB file
    - **chain** - ligand chain ID, here ``Z``
    - **resname** - ligand residue name, in our case ``LIG``
    - **out_in** - sets the defaults for the OutIn simulation
    - **atom_dist** - atom distances to track throughout the simulation
    - **initial_site** - residue corresponding to the starting point of the simulation, on the outside of the protein
    - **final_site** - end point of the simulation, where the ligand is supposed to bind
    - **epsilon** - strength of the bias applied, needs to be between 0 and 1, where 0 corresponds to no bias applied
    - **constraint_level**: - level of constraining alpha carbons of the protein to prevent structure collapse
    - **cpus** - number of CPUs you want to use for the simulation (we suggest a minimum of 50 for a normal simulation, but you could lower it for training purposes only).

..  code-block:: yaml

    system: 'system.pdb'
    chain: 'Z'
    resname: 'LIG'
    out_in: true
    cpus: 60
    epsilon: 0.5
    initial_site: "B:486:O"
    final_site: "B:562:O"  # hinge interaction
    atom_dist:
        - "Z:1000:H1"
        - "B:562:O"
        - "Z:1000:O1"
        - "B:564:H"
    constraint_level: 3

**We strongly recommend running a test first to ensure all your input files are valid.**
Simply include ``test: true`` in your input.yaml and launch the simulation, it will only use 5 CPUs. If it finishes correctly, you can remove the test
flag and start a full production run. Otherwise, inspect the logs and correct any mistakes indicated in the error codes.

3. Launching the simulation
---------------------------

Once you have ``system.pdb`` and ``input.yaml`` in your working directory, you can launch the simulation using one of the following methods:

    - **directly** on command line using ``python -m pele_platform.main input.yaml``

    - submit a slurm file to the **queue system** (ask your IT manager, if you are not sure how to do it). In our case, the slurm file is called ``run.sl`` and we can launch it on the command line using ``sbatch slurm.sl``

Example slurm file:

.. code-block:: console

    #!/bin/bash
    #SBATCH -J PELE
    #SBATCH --output=mpi_%j.out
    #SBATCH --error=mpi_%j.err
    #SBATCH --ntasks=50
    #SBATCH --mem-per-cpu=1000

    python -m pele_platform.main input.yaml

4. Analysis of the results
--------------------------

a. Plots
++++++++

The ``plots`` directory contains several plots to help you get the general idea of the progress of the simulation, showing relationships between
the binding energy and solvent accessible surface area of the ligand, distance between two selected atoms or any other metric of your choice.

For example, ......

b. Top poses
++++++++++++++++++

PELE scans all produced poses and retrieves the top 100 lowest binding energy structures to the ``top_poses`` folder. The file names indicate
the trajectory and model IDs of each structure as well as its associated binding energy.

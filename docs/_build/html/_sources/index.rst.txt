PELE_Platform -  MSM Free Energy Calculation Algorithm 
==================================================

MSM PELE  is a Python library with the aim to calculate absolute free energies
through MSM analysis over paralel monte carlo simulations. Currently, MSM PELE
is build on top of of next softwares:

- Protein Energy Landscape Exploration Software

- Adaptive Sampling Simulation to boost Performance

- Markov State Model Analysis

Technical Features:

- Code is implemented in Python (supports 2.7)

- Runs on Linux (64 bits), Windows or MAC (64 bits).

- OpenmMP&MPI Implementation

- Schrodinger (2016/17/18) is needed.
